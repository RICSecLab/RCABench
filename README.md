# RCABench

RACBench is an end-to-end benchmarking platform for evaluating root cause analysis (RCA) techniques across various targeted programs.

## Overview

Several RCA techniques have been proposed to automatically analyse the causes of software crashes caused by bugs and vulnerabilities. However, the environment for comprehensive evaluation of existing RCA techniques is inadequate, making it difficult to analyse open challenges in the field of RCA. Therefore, we have developed RCABench, a benchmarking platform for automatic and comprehensive evaluation of different RCA techniques.

RCABench was developed as part of a paper accepted for NDSS BAR 2023. If you find our work interesting, please cite our paper.
